Welcome! I am a fourth-year dual-title Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science and Social Data Analytics (SoDA) at Penn State University. I study international political economy, with a particular focus on the role of firms and supply chain relations in the politics of climate change and economic sanctions. Additionally, I work on computational methods, with a focus on deep learning for semantic stance analysis.

I am currently on the Milton B. Dolinger Graduate Fellowship provided by the College of Liberal Arts at Penn State University (2024-2025). Previously, I was awarded the Program in Empirical International Relations (PEIR) Fellowship at Penn State (2023-2024). I received a B.Soc.Sc in Government and International Studies from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I received a full scholarship. I also received an M.Phil. in Politics and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong.
