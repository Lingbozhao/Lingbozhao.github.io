Welcome! I am a third-year dual-title Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science and Social Data Analytics (SoDA) at Penn State University. I study international political economy and foreign policies, with a particular focus on the role of firms/business in the politics of climate change, trades wars, and economic sanctions.

I received a B.Soc.Sc in Government and International Studies from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I received a full scholarship. I also received an M.Phil. in Politics and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong.
